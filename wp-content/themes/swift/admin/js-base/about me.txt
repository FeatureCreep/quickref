When my hosting company complained about the server resources my blog was using, I went on search for a clean lite weight theme. I dint find any theme that matched my needs perfectly, then I decided to develop one on my own, that's how SWIFT was born. He was named SWIFT because of his speed.

SWIFT was first developed for my personal use with no options page. I liked the final output of the theme, so I spent some extra time on it and added some basic options and released it with GPL licence. It was received very well by the WordPress community, that motivated me to work on the theme harder and improve it further.

Thank you swiftler's for your support and feedback, with you SWIFT wouldn't have come this far.
